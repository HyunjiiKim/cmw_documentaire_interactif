    "part1": "In the widely documented story of the Korean War, there is an often forgotten reality: the prisoners of war camps. Today, the island of Geoje is home to one of them: the Geoje Prison Camp Historical Park. A place of remembrance that bears witness to a life suspended between uncertainty, hope and loyalty to their ideals, and that is marked by a conflict with colossal repercussions for the entire country.",
    "part2": "Simultaneously a theater of demands, propaganda and revolt, the representation of this reality still raises many questions today: how can it be told? What remains of these buried memories? We're going to try and understand the work carried out in this historic park, a symbol of a troubled era that still leaves its traces in the present."
