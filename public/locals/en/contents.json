      "3": "Today, the images we have of this camp come from the American administration or the Allied press. They are mostly staged scenes where reality appears subtly. The site, open to visitors since 1997, continues to antagonize prisoners who sympathize with communism and to embellish the conditions of detention."

      "contents": "In 1952, Werner Bischof traveled to Korea on behalf of the Magnum agency. Through his lens, he captured the human scars of war, far from the roar of combat. His photographs of the Geoje camp reflect a profoundly humanistic perspective, where the dignity of the prisoners shines through despite ideological tensions. Between reportage and visual poetry, Bischof recounts a conflict through its silences."

        "1": "When you enter the grounds of the historic park, an inscription greets you: Historic Park of Geoje POW Camp. It is located in the Fountain Square, where the flags of the 16 countries that participated in the Korean War are flying. A large fountain, adorned with statues, symbolizes the joy of the prisoners at the moment of their liberation. This monument pays homage to the end of an era marked by the existence of prisoner camps and celebrates the country's liberation. It perfectly captures the tone of the visit to the historic park, which is part of a primarily visual memorial approach. Here, you will find life-size models of war objects—tanks, planes, transport vehicles—whose function goes beyond a simple demonstration of realism. They bear witness to the omnipresence of militarization in a place initially intended for detention. Far from settling for a military or political approach, the park thus reveals not only suffering but also resistance and solidarity: essential dimensions for understanding the complexity of life in the camp. It is not simply a story of captivity, but a place of internal struggles, multiple forms of violence, and episodes of survival. Thus, throughout their tour, visitors are immersed in the oppressive atmosphere of the prisoners' experience: gunshots, explosions, chants, and war cries accompany them along the entire visit.",
        "2": "The aerial model of the camp offers an overall view, allowing one to grasp the scale and the prison-like logic of the camp at a glance."

        "para2": "This former place of confinement and tension is now set up with reconstructions and mannequins, oscillating between the duty of remembrance and the spectacle of trauma. Its \"heritagization\" is, in effect, translated into a visitor trail that incorporates explanatory panels and scenographic displays designed to offer an accessible and engaging interpretation of the past. The visitor is invited to delve back into the troubled period of the Korean War by discovering the daily life and tensions of the Geoje camp.",
        "para3": "This transformation, however, raises a series of ambiguities, characteristic of the tensions between memory and tourism, between historical transmission and staging. The camp embodies the recent changes in how history is transmitted in societies where media and tourism profoundly influence the ways we access the past. Behind the scenography, a certain way of thinking about, telling, and sharing history is at play.",

      "1": "Geoje was more than a camp. It was a space of tension, survival, ideology, and at times, silence. A place where History intersected with ordinary actions: eating, obeying, waiting, singing, believing, fleeing. The walls have long since disappeared, swallowed by time, reconstructions, and the need to forget. But the stories remain. Fragmented, contradictory, often uncomfortable—they survive in photos, letters, and the silences of survivors. Today, it is no longer the barbed wire that confines, but the multiple versions of what really happened. Everyone holds on to an image, a version, a detail.",
